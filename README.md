<h1 align="center">📚 Overview 📚</h1>
<p align="center">
    <i>This project aims to tackle the problems of Energy mismanagement, Increasing Carbon Footprint and Surging Utility Costs. It falls within the intersection of IoT (Internet of Things), Machine Learning, and Energy Management Systems. It uses IoT sensors to collect real-time energy consumption data, which is then processed and analyzed using ML algorithms like Linear Regression for consumption prediction and DBSCAN for anomaly detection. The backend, built with Flask, handles data retrieval, management, and storage, enabling a seamless user experience. The system's primary goal is to optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and support sustainability efforts by providing actionable insights and predictive analytics for better decision-making in real-world applications.</i>

<h1 align="center">💡 Idea 💡</h1>
<p align="center">
    WattSmart Wizard is designed to tackle inefficiencies in energy, power, costs by utilizing cutting-edge technologies like IoT, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning. Below are the core features:
</p>

- **Real-Time Energy Data Collection**  
  Energy consumption data is captured using IoT sensors connected to an ESP32 device, enabling wireless transmission of real-time readings for seamless monitoring.
- **Cloud-Based Data Storage & Management**  
  Data is securely stored on the cloud, allowing for scalable storage and remote access, enabling long-term analysis and retrieval.
- **Seamless Data Retrieval for Processing**  
  Data is fetched via a RESTful API to enable smooth integration between cloud storage and backend systems for real-time processing and insights.
- **Data Analysis & Insight Generation**  
  Data is processed using Python and data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to uncover usage patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **Forecasting & Anomaly Detection**  
  Machine learning models (Linear Regression for power consumption prediction and DBSCAN for anomaly detection) identify future energy usage, predict costs, and flag unexpected consumption spikes.
- **Interactive Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring**  
  A Flask-based web application displays dynamic insights, predictions, and alerts, providing users with actionable data on their energy consumption and cost-saving opportunities.
- **Impact on Energy Efficiency & Cost Reduction**  
  The system helps users optimize energy usage, detect inefficiencies, and reduce costs, contributing to sustainability and more efficient energy consumption.
